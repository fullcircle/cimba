/**
 * @brief Defines a prototype for the user-implemented function to execute a single
 * trial of the experiment.
 *
 * Your simulated universe lives inside this function, using the tools provided
 * by Cimba. The argument points to a user-defined trial struct containing the
 * parameters to and the results from the trial. It is defined as a `void*` here
 * since we do not know what your struct will contain. The trial function does
 * not return a value but stores the results in the same struct as the
 * parameters.
 *
 * This function will be executed in parallel with other instances of itself in
 * a shared memory space. Do _not_ use writeable global variables to share data
 * between functions inside your simulated world. Do _not_ use static local
 * variables to remember values between calls to some function. If you do, it
 * will easily lead to undefined behavior when different threads execute in
 * parallel in the same memory space, reading and writing the variable values in
 * unpredictable sequences. Using normal (auto) local variables and function
 * arguments is safe.
 *
 * If you absolutely must have a global or static variable to be shared between
 * function calls, declare it `CMB_THREAD_LOCAL` to keep it local to that
 * simulation thread (but it may still be shared across successive trials that
 * happen to share the same worker thread, with possibly unexpected results
 * unless you are careful in initializing and clearing the variable in each
 * trial). Alternatively, put a `mutex` on it, or other methods to make it
 * thread safe.

/**
 * @brief The main simulation function, executing a user-defined experiment
 * consisting of several trials in parallel.
 *
 * The experiment is an array of your trial structs, containing any combination
 * of parameter variations and replications that you need. The trial struct
 * stores the parameters going into each trial and the results coming from it.
 *
 * The run will call your trial function once for each member of your array,
 * executing in parallel on as many CPU cores as the computer has available.
 * It also needs to know the number of trials in your experiment and the size
 * of your trial struct to do the necessary pointer calculations.
 *
 * Your trial function is responsible for setting up the simulation from
 * parameters given in the trial struct, starting it (typically by calling
 * `cmb_event_queue_execute()`, collecting the results, and storing them back to
 * the trial struct. Note that no end time is given as an argument here. You
 * need to determine the appropriate closing time and schedule an event for that
 * inside your simulation. See `test/test_cimba.c` for an example.
 *
 * When `cimba_run_experiment()` returns, the results fields of the trial
 * structs that constitute your experiment array will be filled in.
 *
 * In some cases, different trial functions may be needed for individual trials
 * of the experiment. To run multiple trial functions in parallel, set the
 * `your_trial_func` argument to `NULL` and store the trial function to use as
 * the first member of each trial struct in the experiment. That way, you can
 * run different simulations for each trial in your experiment if required.
 *
 * It is also possible to (ab)use `cimba_run_experiment()` to parallelize other
 * functions than Cimba simulations. The trial function can be any function
 * that matches the pattern `void func(void *arg)`, effectively using
 * `cimba_run_experiment()` as a user-friendly pthreads wrapper to parallelize
 * any CPU-bound function with limited input and output requirements.
 *
 * @param your_experiment_array Your user-defined array of trials to be run.
 * @param num_trials The number of trials in the array.
 * @param trial_struct_size The size of your trial struct in bytes.
 * @param your_trial_func Pointer to the trial function to be executed. If NULL,
 *                        the first member of each trial struct will be assumed
 *                        to be a pointer to the trial function to be executed
 *                        for that particular trial.
